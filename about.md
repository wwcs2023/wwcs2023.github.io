The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems (WWCS) is a one-week workshop where young researchers from all over world come together to work together on interdisciplinary projects around complex systems. The primary focus of the workshop is to connect participants from different research disciplines to peers with a shared interest in complex systems while working on novel research projects. During the workshop participants work on research projects whose preliminary results are presented at the end of the workshop. Participants are free to propose research projects and to discuss them already before the beginning of the workshop.

The workshop originates from the initiative of a few individuals attending the [Santa Fe Institute Summer School on Complex Systems](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/programs/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school) in 2014. The group sequentially became part of the current WWCS Steering Committee. Over the years, the workshop has grown into a larger community attracting young researchers from all over the world.
